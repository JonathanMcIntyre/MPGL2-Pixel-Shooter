Description:
Pixel Shooter is an application designed by Jonathan McIntyre. It is a simple game where the user controls a gun on the left hand of the screen. The user can move the gun up and down using the vertical captouch slider. The right button is used to shoot. Only one bullet can be shot at a time. There is no limit to the number of bullets that can be shot. Three pixel blocks appear at the right side of the screen, which move steadily towards the left. The object of the game is to prevent the pixel blocks from reaching the left end of the screen by shooting them down. However, as soon as a block is shot down, another takes its place at the right end of the screen. In order to win, the user must last about a minute without a single block reaching the left end of the screen.
